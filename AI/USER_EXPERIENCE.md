# User Experience Standards for Computo

## Purpose

This document defines the user experience goals and standards that should guide any rewrite or enhancement of Computo. These standards ensure that technical excellence translates into genuine usability for developers integrating Computo into their systems.

## Core User Experience Philosophy

### 1. **Predictability Over Cleverness**
- Consistent behavior is more valuable than surprising optimizations
- If a user can predict the outcome of an operation, they can debug it
- Magic happens behind the scenes, but results should be explainable

### 2. **Clear Intent Over Conciseness** 
- Error messages should explain what went wrong and how to fix it
- Operator behavior should be obvious from the name and arguments
- Documentation should address "why" not just "what"

### 3. **Fast Feedback Loops**
- Errors should be caught and reported as early as possible
- Interactive development (REPL) should feel immediate and responsive
- Build and test cycles should be under 5 seconds for typical changes

## User Personas and Use Cases

- Performance monitoring integrates with standard tools

## Error Experience Standards

### Error Message Principles

#### **Be Specific About Location**
**Good**: `Error at /let/body/map: Unknown operator "filer". Did you mean "filter"?`
**Bad**: `Invalid operator`

#### **Provide Context and Suggestions**
**Good**: `Error at /users/0/age: Expected number, got string "twenty-five". Use ["toNumber", value] to convert strings to numbers.`
**Bad**: `Type error`

#### **Include Recovery Information**
**Good**: `Array object malformed at /data: "array" key must contain an array, got string. Use {"array": [...]} syntax for literal arrays.`
**Bad**: `Malformed array object`

#### **Distinguish User Errors from System Errors**
- **User Errors**: Clear explanation + suggestion for fix
- **System Errors**: Include enough info for bug reports + workaround if available

### Error Message Tone Guidelines

- **Professional but Human**: Avoid both technical jargon and overly casual language
- **Helpful not Condescending**: Assume the user knows what they're trying to do
- **Action-Oriented**: Focus on what the user can do to fix the problem
- **Consistent Terminology**: Use the same terms the user sees in documentation

### Error Context Requirements

Every error should include:
1. **Location**: Precise path where error occurred
2. **Expectation**: What the system expected to find
3. **Reality**: What it actually found
4. **Suggestion**: Specific action to resolve (when possible)

## Performance Experience Standards

### Response Time Expectations

#### **Interactive Operations (REPL)**
- **Expression Evaluation**: < 50ms for simple operations
- **Variable Inspection**: < 10ms for any scope size
- **Command Processing**: < 5ms for built-in commands
- **Startup Time**: < 500ms from launch to ready prompt

#### **Batch Operations (CLI)**
- **Script Loading**: < 100ms for files up to 1MB
- **Single Transformation**: < 10ms for JSON up to 10KB
- **Large Data Processing**: < 1ms per operation on arrays up to 10K items
- **Memory Usage**: Peak usage < 3x input size for any transformation

#### **Library Integration**
- **First Call Overhead**: < 5ms for operator registry initialization
- **Subsequent Calls**: < 1ms overhead over pure JSON processing
- **Thread Scaling**: Linear performance improvement up to 8 threads
- **Memory Footprint**: < 50MB baseline, < 10MB per additional thread

### Performance Feedback Requirements

Users should be able to answer these questions without external tools:
- How long did my transformation take?
- How much memory did it use?
- Which operators are the bottlenecks?
- How will performance scale with larger data?

### Performance Degradation Handling

When performance degrades:
- **Graceful**: Operations slow down but remain functional
- **Predictable**: Users can anticipate which operations will be slow
- **Recoverable**: System returns to normal performance after load decreases
- **Informative**: Users understand why performance degraded

## REPL Experience Standards

### Interactive Flow Requirements

#### **Immediate Feedback**
- Result display immediately after expression completion
- Error highlighting at point of failure
- Visual distinction between user input and system output

#### **Context Preservation**
- Previous results accessible via `_1`, `_2`, etc.
- Variable bindings persist across expressions
- Command history navigable with arrow keys

#### **Discovery Support**
- `help` command shows context-appropriate information
- Tab completion for operators and commands
- Operator documentation accessible without leaving REPL

### Development Workflow Support

#### **Debugging Experience**
- `vars` command shows current variable scope clearly
- Error messages include exact location in nested expressions
- Ability to step through complex expressions (future enhancement)

#### **Experimentation Support**
- Easy modification and re-execution of previous expressions
- Safe testing of destructive operations
- Clear distinction between test data and real data

## C++ Library Integration Experience

### Developer Onboarding

#### **First Success in Under 30 Minutes**
```cpp
#include <computo.hpp>
auto result = computo::execute(["+", 1, 2, 3]);
// Should work immediately after include
```

#### **Error Handling That Makes Sense**
```cpp
try {
    auto result = computo::execute(script, input);
} catch (const computo::InvalidArgumentException& e) {
    // Error message points to exact problem and solution
}
```

#### **Performance That's Obvious**
```cpp
// Users should be able to predict performance characteristics
auto small_result = computo::execute(small_script, small_data);   // ~1ms
auto large_result = computo::execute(small_script, large_data);   // ~10ms
auto complex_result = computo::execute(complex_script, small_data); // ~5ms
```

### Integration Requirements

#### **Minimal Dependencies**
- Single header include or simple package manager integration
- No conflicting dependencies with common C++ libraries
- CMake integration that doesn't interfere with existing build systems

#### **Thread Safety That Just Works**
- No special initialization required for multi-threaded use
- Concurrent execution without performance bottlenecks
- Clear documentation of any thread-safety limitations

#### **Memory Management Integration**
- Works with existing memory management strategies
- Predictable memory usage patterns
- No memory leaks under any usage pattern

## Documentation Experience Standards

### Learning Curve Management

#### **Progressive Disclosure**
- Basic examples work immediately
- Advanced features build naturally on basics
- Reference documentation doesn't overwhelm beginners

#### **Multiple Learning Paths**
- **Tutorial Path**: Step-by-step for first-time users
- **Reference Path**: Quick lookup for experienced users
- **Example Path**: Working solutions for common problems

### Real-World Relevance

#### **Examples That Match Actual Use Cases**
- JSON API transformations (authentication, format conversion)
- Data pipeline processing (filtering, aggregation, reshaping)
- Configuration processing (validation, defaults, environment-specific values)

#### **Error Scenarios That Actually Happen**
- Malformed input data handling
- Missing fields and null value processing
- Type conversion and validation patterns

## Quality Assurance Standards

### User Acceptance Criteria

#### **Can a New User Succeed?**
- Fresh developer can complete basic tutorial in under 1 hour
- Common error scenarios include helpful recovery instructions
- Documentation answers the questions users actually ask

#### **Does It Scale to Real Problems?**
- Performance remains predictable with large data sets
- Complex transformations remain debuggable
- Error handling covers edge cases that occur in production

#### **Is It Maintainable Over Time?**
- Transformation logic is self-documenting
- Changes to transformations don't break unexpectedly
- Debugging production issues doesn't require Computo expertise

### Regression Prevention

Any change to Computo should be tested against these questions:
1. **Did user-facing error messages become less helpful?**
2. **Did response times increase for common operations?**
3. **Did the learning curve become steeper for new users?**
4. **Did integration become more complex or fragile?**

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Measures
- **Time to First Success**: New user completes basic transformation < 30 minutes
- **Error Resolution Rate**: Users fix 80%+ of errors using only error messages
- **Performance Consistency**: 95th percentile response time < 2x median
- **Integration Success**: Library integration < 1 hour for experienced C++ developers

### Qualitative Measures
- **Developer Satisfaction**: "I understand what went wrong and how to fix it"
- **Performance Confidence**: "I can predict how this will perform in production"
- **Maintenance Comfort**: "I can modify this transformation safely"
- **Documentation Effectiveness**: "I found the answer to my question quickly"

## Implementation Guidelines for AI Rewrite

### Design Decisions Should Prioritize User Experience
- When choosing between implementation approaches, select the one that produces better error messages
- Performance optimizations should not compromise error clarity
- API design should optimize for common use cases, not edge cases

### Testing Should Include User Experience Validation
- Error message quality should be tested systematically
- Performance tests should validate user-facing expectations, not just technical metrics
- Integration testing should simulate real developer workflows

### Documentation Should Be User-Centric
- Start with what users are trying to accomplish, not what the system can do
- Include failure scenarios and recovery patterns
- Provide multiple learning paths for different user backgrounds

## Conclusion

Excellent user experience in a technical tool like Computo comes from the accumulation of many small decisions that prioritize user needs over implementation convenience. Every error message, performance characteristic, and API design choice should be evaluated against the question: "Does this help users accomplish their goals more effectively?"

The goal of any Computo rewrite should be to maintain all the technical capabilities while significantly improving the experience of the humans who integrate, debug, and maintain Computo-based systems in production environments.
