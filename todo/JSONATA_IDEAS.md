### Category 1: Robust Data Access and Error Handling

This directly addresses your point about graceful failures. The current `["get", obj, "/path"]` is brittle; if the path doesn't exist, the whole execution likely fails with an exception. This is undesirable when processing heterogeneous or incomplete data.

#### 1. `tryGet` (or `getOrDefault`)
This is the operator you suggested, and it's essential. It attempts to retrieve a value using a JSON Pointer, but returns a default value on failure instead of throwing an error.

*   **Signature:** `["tryGet", object, path, defaultValue]`
*   **Example:**
    ```json
    // Input: {"user": {"name": "Alice"}}
    ["tryGet", ["$input"], "/user/address/city", "N/A"] 
    // Result: "N/A"
    ```
*   **Why it's crucial:** Prevents entire transformations from failing due to optional or missing fields. It's the most common requirement in data mapping.

#### 2. `has`
Checks for the existence of a value at a path without retrieving it.

*   **Signature:** `["has", object, path]`
*   **Example:**
    ```json
    // Input: {"user": {"name": "Alice"}}
    ["has", ["$input"], "/user/name"]  // Result: true
    ["has", ["$input"], "/user/age"]   // Result: false
    ```
*   **Why it's crucial:** Enables conditional logic based on the shape of the data, which is more robust than checking for `null`.

#### 3. `getPathCoalesce`
This is a more powerful version of `tryGet`. It takes an object and a list of paths, and returns the value from the *first* path that resolves successfully. This is incredibly useful for mapping data from multiple possible legacy formats.

*   **Signature:** `["getPathCoalesce", object, [path1, path2, ...], defaultValue]`
*   **Example:**
    ```json
    // Input: {"contact_email": "a@b.com"}
    ["getPathCoalesce", 
      ["$input"],
      {"array": ["/user/email", "/contact_email", "/email_address"]},
      "no-email-found"
    ]
    // Result: "a@b.com"
    ```
*   **Why it's crucial:** Drastically simplifies mapping from evolving or inconsistent source schemas.

### Category 2: Advanced Object Manipulation

Computo has `obj` for creation and `merge` for shallow merging. This can be expanded.

#### 4. `keys` and `values`
Standard dictionary operations that are surprisingly absent but fundamental.

*   **Signature:** `["keys", object]`, `["values", object]`
*   **Example:**
    ```json
    ["keys", {"a": 1, "b": 2}] // Result: {"array": ["a", "b"]}
    ```
*   **Why it's crucial:** Needed for iterating over or extracting an object's properties dynamically.

#### 5. `objFromPairs`
Creates an object from an array of key-value pairs. The `reduce` and `zip` example in the README is powerful, but far too verbose for such a common task.

*   **Signature:** `["objFromPairs", {"array": [["key1", "val1"], ["key2", "val2"]]}]`
*   **Example:**
    ```json
    ["objFromPairs", 
      ["zip", {"array": ["a", "b"]}, {"array": [1, 2]}]
    ]
    // Result: {"a": 1, "b": 2}
    ```
*   **Why it's crucial:** Provides a direct, readable way to dynamically construct objects, a cornerstone of data shaping.

#### 6. `pick` and `omit`
Selects or removes a subset of keys from an object, similar to Lodash/Underscore.

*   **Signature:** `["pick", object, {"array": ["keyToKeep1", "keyToKeep2"]}]`
*   **Signature:** `["omit", object, {"array": ["keyToRemove1"]}]`
*   **Example:**
    ```json
    ["pick", {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}, {"array": ["a", "c"]}]
    // Result: {"a": 1, "c": 3}
    ```
*   **Why it's crucial:** Essential for filtering sensitive data or trimming objects down to just the required fields.

### Category 3: Powerful String and Type Operations

Real-world data is messy. Robust string and type handling is non-negotiable.

#### 7. `test` (Regex Match)
Tests if a string matches a regular expression.

*   **Signature:** `["test", string, regexPattern]`
*   **Example:**
    ```json
    ["test", "Computo-v1", "^Computo"] // Result: true
    ```

#### 8. `split` and `join`
The classic operations for splitting a string into an array and vice-versa.

*   **Signature:** `["split", string, delimiter]`, `["join", {"array": [...]}, separator]`
*   **Example:**
    ```json
    ["split", "John Doe", " "] // Result: {"array": ["John", "Doe"]}
    ```

#### 9. `toType` (Type Casting)
A safe type-casting function is more robust than relying on implicit language behavior.

*   **Signature:** `["toType", value, "targetType"]` (where targetType is "number", "string", "boolean")
*   **Example:**
    ```json
    ["toType", "123.45", "number"] // Result: 123.45
    ["toType", 0, "boolean"]       // Result: false
    ```
*   **Why it's crucial:** Data often comes in as strings ("5") when numbers (5) are needed. This provides explicit, safe conversion.

---

### Category 4: Enhanced Control Flow

The `if` is a simple ternary. A multi-branch conditional is more powerful.

#### 10. `cond` (Conditional Expression)
A multi-branch `if-elseif-else` structure, common in Lisp (`cond`). It evaluates condition/result pairs in order and returns the result of the first true condition.

*   **Signature:** `["cond", [condition1, result1], [condition2, result2], ..., [true, defaultResult]]`
*   **Example:**
    ```json
    ["let", [["score", 85]],
      ["cond",
        [">", ["$", "/score"], 90], "A",
        [">", ["$", "/score"], 80], "B",
        [">", ["$", "/score"], 70], "C",
        [true, "D"]
      ]
    ]
    // Result: "B"
    ```
*   **Why it's crucial:** Avoids horrible-to-read nested `if` statements for complex conditional logic, making the code much cleaner.

### Putting It All Together: A Before-and-After

Let's re-tackle the transformation from the first response.

**Source JSON:**
```json
{ "id": 123, "user_name": "jane_doe", "details": { "full_name": "Jane Doe" } }
```
**Target JSON:**
```json
{ "accountId": "user-123", "firstName": "Jane", "lastName": "Doe", "region": "USA" }
```

**Transformation in "New" Computo:**

```json
["obj",
  ["accountId", ["strConcat", "user-", ["toType", ["get", ["$input"], "/id"], "string"]]],
  ["firstName", ["get", ["split", ["tryGet", ["$input"], "/details/full_name", ""], " "], "/0"]],
  ["lastName",  ["get", ["split", ["tryGet", ["$input"], "/details/full_name", ""], " "], "/1"]],
  ["region", ["tryGet", ["$input"], "/region", "USA"]]
]
```
This script is now far more robust. It won't crash if `details` or `full_name` is missing (it will produce null/empty fields), and it correctly handles the optional `region` field with a default. This is a massive leap in practical usability.

By adding these operators, **Computo would shift from a powerful functional core to a complete data transformation toolkit.** It would compete directly with JSONata on features while retaining its unique advantages of performance, thread safety, and a homoiconic syntax.
